# JetNtupleProducerTool - a Jet tuple producer from CMS OpenData MiniAOD

This is a CMSSW module for producing mostly flat tuples from 13 TeV Run2 MC samples.

The code is intended to run inside the CMS Virtual Machine environment.

## Setting up

First install the CMS Docker image as per instructions here: http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-guide-docker
This module has been tested on CMSSW_10_6_8_patch1

Then open up the terminal and create the work area:
```
cmsenv                  # activates the CMSSW environment
git clone https://github.com/jblue1/JetNtupleProducerTool.git
git checkout partons # checkout this branch
scram b                 # compiles the code
cd JetNtupleProducerTool/JetAnalyzer
```

## Running the code

One can change the conditions for the code execution (most notably, the amount of processed events) in the file ```python/ConfFile_cfg.py```.

To generate the ntuples, execute
```
cmsRun python/ConfFile_cfg.py
```

This configuration file runs the ```plugins/JetAnalyzer.cc``` code, which performs the data processing and extracts the jets from collision events. There is an additional configuration file ```python/QGLikelihood_cfi.py```, which is there for the quark/gluon jet likelihood variables. It references the ```database/QGL_cmssw8020_v2.db``` file. There is no need to touch these QGL files.

## Data exploration
To quickly explore the created file, first load it up in ROOT
```
root -l JetNtuple_RunIISummer16_13TeV_MC.root
```
Here you can create a ```TBrowser``` and examine the contents of the file and the distributions for each variable.
```
new TBrowser
```

## Content of the tuples

### jetTree


Variables are saved to ROOT trees jet by jet.

In this version, the reconstructed jets are AK4 jets clustered from Particle Flow candidates. The standard L1+L2+L3+residual energy corrections are applied to the jets and pileup is reduced using the CHS algorithm.
